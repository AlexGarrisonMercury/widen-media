# Widen Media

> Search & add Widen digital assets to your WordPress media library.

This WordPress plugin lets users search for images in [Widen](https://www.widen.com/) and add them to their site's media library. This plugin does not download media from Widen but rather creates a new WordPress media attachment that refers to the Widen asset URL.

## Setup

`WIDEN_MEDIA_ACCESS_TOKEN` must be defined within your site's wp-config.php.

This plugin uses [V2 of the Widen API](https://widenv2.docs.apiary.io/).
